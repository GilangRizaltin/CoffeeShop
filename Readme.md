Welcome to the Coffee Shop Project â€“ a web development endeavor that transcends the ordinary to craft a vibrant and dynamic website tailored exclusively for cafes. In this caffeinated journey, we harness the power of APIs for a symphony of operations, seamlessly orchestrating the dance of GET (fetching data), POST (sending data), PATCH (partially modifying data), and DELETE (bidding farewell to data). Picture this project as a canvas brought to life with the strokes of Javascript, where Node.js takes center stage as the maestro executing the symphony. Express.js steps in as the trusty assistant, deftly managing servers and routes, while PostgreSQL stands as the repository for our data treasures. And for the grand finale, enter Postman, the virtuoso crafting APIs with finesse. Join us on this journey where code meets coffee, and every API call is a sip of innovation in the ever-evolving world of web development!
